# Brain-Tumor-Prediction-Using_MATLAB
A brain tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue in which cells grow and replicate uncontrollably, seemingly unfettered by normal cell regulatory processes. The extraction and analysis of brain tumors are difficult jobs in medical image processing due to the complexity of the brain image. In medical image processing, segmentation is extremely significant. As a result, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has emerged as a valuable medical diagnostic tool for brain and other medical images. This project explores a specific use case wherein MATLAB GUI is employed to analyze MRI scans of brain tumor patients. Â
